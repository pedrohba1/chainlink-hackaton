# Hardhat project for the Owl papers project

This project contains all smart contracts and their tests for the Owl Papers Hackaton project.

The events from the smart contracts are being listened in Moralis and added to a database for easier fetching.

Currently, only the `ArticleMinted` event is being listened, to add to the database all the new minted NFTs.

UPDATE: The Market contract is being listened now by Moralis.
